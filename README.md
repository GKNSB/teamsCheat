# teamsCheat
Ever wanted to always keep that status icon in Teams always green? Do you have trouble deactivating that powersaving lock-screen thingy? Well look no further. The script will move the mouse ever so slightly and hit `shift` a couple of times and your problems is solved. 

```
pip3 install pyautogui

python3 teamsCheat.py 
or
python3 teamsCheat.py <minute interval>
```

Also available as a standalone binary in the releases section if you just want to double click it, but you know, I wouldn't blame you if you don't trust me.
